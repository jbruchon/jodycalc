                         Jody's Little Calculator
                   by Jody Bruchon <jody@jodybruchon.com>

This is a project I'm writing as part of my compiler autodidacticism. While
it initially seems ridiculous to write a calculator application, it is a
most excellent exercise in writing many of the major components of a
langauge compiler or interpreter. Inside you'll find an application that can
handle many constructs that are much more difficult than simply adding two
numbers. This program currently supports:

* Typical simple calculator functions: + - / * ^ %
* Variables with names up to 16 characters long
* Parenthetical expression grouping
* Setting variables to the value of an expression

It does not support mathematical order of operations. The parser would need
to perform extra look-ahead or an extra pass to add parentheses as needed to
enforce proper order of operations.

Since it's mainly for my learning and amusement, I don't expect anyone to
find this particularly interesting, but if you find it and benefit from the
code somehow, please send me an email and let me know. Thanks!
